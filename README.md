# Trimage image compressor

A cross-platform tool for optimizing PNG and JPG files.

Trimage is a cross-platform GUI and command-line interface to optimize image files via [advpng](http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/comp-readme.html), [jpegoptim](http://www.kokkonen.net/tjko/projects.html), [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net) and [pngcrush](https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush) depending on the
filetype (currently, PNG and JPG files are supported).
It was inspired by
[imageoptim](http://imageoptim.pornel.net).

All image files are losslessly
compressed on the highest available compression levels. Trimage gives you
various input functions to fit your own workflow: a regular file dialog,
dragging and dropping and various command line options.
