==========================================
todo app wise
- general refactoring
- sys.exit(1) for errors -- how to handle? Not good to simply sys.exit() from
    any random part of code (can leave things in a mess)
- consider context managers for handling compression, so as to keep operations
    atomic and/or rollback-able

- add a recursive option on the command-line for use with -d
- make -f accept a list of files
- make the current verbose be "normal", and make -verbose print the commandline
    app prints as well

- verify that a *recompressed* file is smaller than the compressed one
- find a way to specify the version once for everywhere
- notification area drag/drop widget
- save chosen directory and geometry/screen position using QSettings
- recompress stopped working

todo else
- figure out how to make mac and win versions (someone else :) <- via gui2exe


===========================================
later versions:
    animate compressing.gif
    allow selection/deletion of rows from table (and subsequently the imagelist)
    punypng api? http://www.gracepointafterfive.com/punypng/api
    imagemagick/graphicsmagick?
    always on top option
    intelligently recompress, i.e. go through the list of files, recompress
        each until no more gains are seen (and a sensible number-of-tries limit
        isn't exceeded), and flag that file as fully-optimised. Repeat for each
        file in the list, until all are done. Saves pointlessly trying to
        optimise files. Consider the case of a directory of 100 files, already
        optimised once. Recompressing maximally compresses 90. Recompressing
        again would currently try to recompress all 100, when only 10 would be
        worthy of trying to compress further.


1.1.0 changes:
- use multiprocessing for images
- more robust file handling
- re-adding images now results in recompressing them
- compressing message now shows filename
- wider array of status messages in the table
