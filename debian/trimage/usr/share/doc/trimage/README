Trimage image compressor
A cross-platform tool for optimizing PNG and JPG files.

Trimage is a cross-platform GUI and command-line interface to optimize image
files via "optipng":http://optipng.sourceforge.net/,
"advpng":http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/comp-readme.html and
"guetzli":https://github.com/google/guetzli, depending on the
filetype (currently, PNG and JPG files are supported). It was inspired by
"imageoptim":http://imageoptim.pornel.net/. All image files are losslessly
compressed on the highest available compression levels. Trimage gives you
various input functions to fit your own workflow: A regular file dialog,
dragging and dropping and various command line options.
